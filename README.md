### About

A Hack the North 2019 submission, StudyBud is an ongoing project to build an extension that can automatically generate citations and recommends other
links and resources for referencing.

### To-Do:
- [ ] finish UI appearance
- [ ] fix information in citation generation
- [ ] implement API calls further

### Credits
The fonts used are [Quicksand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand) and 
[Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto). This project involved using tools such as VSCode and [UIKit](https://getuikit.com/).
Resources such as API documentation and the 
[MDN Developer Guides](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide) were helpful to development. There is a plan to implement Microsoft Azure services,
specifically search and text analysis. You can read more about this project on [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/studybud).
